# dotfiles

The idea of this repo is to auto setup a new distro with all the little things I wat to be on my linux machine

# Installing

In order to install the `install.sh` script has to be called as follow:

```bash 
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

#### *Deprecated behavior*
~~*If not called like this the source of the `~/.bashrc` file will not be called propperly and the changes will only be visible after restarting the terminal, or running `source` command manually*~~

After running the `install.sh` script, either restart the terminal or run the command below for the changes in the terminal to take effect

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
